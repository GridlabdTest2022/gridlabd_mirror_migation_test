        <H1>Welcome GridLAB-D User</H1>

        <P/>

        This is probably not what you are looking for.  Your query is likely missing information about the code object you wish to download.

        <P/>

        This endpoint is used to download code objects in the GridLAB-D repository.  For example,
        the command 

        <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>% curl https://code.gridlabd.us/master/README.md</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

        will return the <CODE>master</CODE> branch's version of the <CODE>README.md</CODE> file.

        <P/>

        Note that unauthenticated access is rate limited.  Please see <A HREF="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/rate-limit">GitHub API Rate Limits</A> for more information.
