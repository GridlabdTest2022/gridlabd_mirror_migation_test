    "GridLAB-D is an agent-based modeling and simulation environment that models systems as a collection of semi-independent entities called agents.  Each agent operates independently by assessing its situation and changing its state according to a set of rules.  Some of these rules are unique to each agent, while other rules may be associated with classes of agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agent usually execute rules in response to events that are generated by the simulation environment. These events help ensure state consistency for agents belonging to closely related classes, which are collected in modules.  For example, certain properties of electric power system agents must obey power flow laws such as Kirchoff's law and Telegan's law. All the agents that are contribute to solve the power flow problem are collected in classes belonging to the _powerflow_ module.  Events are generated by the simulation environment that are handled by powerflow classes help synchronize the states of electric power system agents."

    "**Skill 1(a)**: Defining a class requires one to specify both the important properties of a category of objects in a model.  Generally, the choice of properties is based on the requirements for the model.  If we want to model how susceptible a tree is to high wind, then `height`, `age`, and `type` may be very important properties, but `width` might not be.  However, if we want to model how susceptible a tree is to fire, then `width` and `stressed` may be important as well.  The choice of properties also requires consideration of whether and how one acquires the data required to populate a model.  The choice of dimensions (the units), representation (whether to use integer, real, or complex numbers, booleans, sets, enumeration, or text), and naming conventions are all important considerations as well.  Among GridLAB-D users, there are some conventions that are generally observed, which will become evident throughout the tutorials.  These include the following:\n",
    "1. avoiding the use the acronyms, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon;\n",
    "2. specifying units whenever possible;\n",
    "3. using lowercase for names and uppercase for constants;\n",
    "4. being careful about how redundancy in what properties describe is addressed, e.g., allowing alternative ways of describing the same thing but being clear about what happens when both are provided but they don't agree; and\n",
    "5. being clear about what the default is if the property is not required."
