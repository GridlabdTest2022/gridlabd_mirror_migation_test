#
# This file is used to create the initial make configuration
#
# Command syntax:
#
#   $ ./initial
#
# or
#
#   $ make -f initial
#
# Usual follow-up command
#
#   $ make system
#
# Note: if you run this makefile after the build is configured,
# then if will run exactly as the configured makefile, i.e.,
#
#   $ make -f initial system
#
# is the same as
#
#   $ ./initial system
